## Individual Project 2: Rust CLI Binary with SQLite 

### Summary 
Rust is a systems programming language that focuses on performance, safety, and concurrency. It was first released in 2010 and has been developed as an open-source project, primarily sponsored by Mozilla. Rust ecosystem has been growing rapidly, with a strong package manager (cargo) and a growing number of libraries. In this project, we will use Rust to compile with SQLite CLI that we used to write in Python. we will demonstrates CRUD operations using Rust on the SQLite database. 

### Steps
1. create repo that folked from previous project.
2. added `Cargo.toml` that specifies dependecies in rust
3. change python codes to rust code with the help of generative AI tools
4. make test of the code using cargo.

### Demo 
A YouTubde video will walk you through the whole process.
